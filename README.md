# Study Saturdays: Week 3 - React-Redux

## **Objective:** Build an app to display students and their test scores
- [x] **Cycle 0:** Build the store
- [x] **Cycle 1:** `connect` the React component
- [x] **Cycle 2:** Set up React Router for a "single student" view
- [ ] **Cycle 3:** Make the single student route functional ⭐️
- [ ] **Cycle 4 (Bonus):** Delete a student

## Steps

- [ ] Fetch the single student's data and display it
  - [ ] Edit the `store.js` file to handle single student data
    - Hint: How did you do this in cycle-1?
  - [ ] Edit the `SingleStudent.js` component file to connect to the Redux store and display the student data
    - Hint: Remember to replace the `DUMMY_DATA` with your "real" data
    - Hint: You'll need the student's `id` in order to fetch their data. Where can you get that from?
- [ ] Once done and tested, `git checkout cycle-4-bonus`


Detail Steps:
- add single student: action type, action creator, thunk creator, initial state, reducer
- connect single student component with the store: edit export default
- create mapState, mapDispatch function
- add componentDidMount function and call the needed function
- get the data and log in console
- edit the render page (need to add if/else student to check if sinfle stdent is undefined)
